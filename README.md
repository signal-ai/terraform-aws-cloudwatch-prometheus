# terraform-aws-cloudwatch-prometheus

[![CircleCI](https://dl.circleci.com/status-badge/img/gh/signal-ai/terraform-aws-cloudwatch-prometheus/tree/main.svg?style=svg)](https://dl.circleci.com/status-badge/redirect/gh/signal-ai/terraform-aws-cloudwatch-prometheus/tree/main)

Are you fed up with the costs, faf and effort of maintaining cloudwatch exporters to get metrics into your prometheus setup?
Maybe you are using one of the following:

- [Official Cloudwatch Prometheus Exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/cloudwatch_exporter)
- [YACE - Yet Another Prometheus Exporter](https://github.com/nerdswords/yet-another-cloudwatch-exporter)

These are expensive and costly in terms of number of API calls no matter how you look at it.

Thankfully AWS released [Cloudwatch Metric Steams](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/cloudwatch-metric-streams-send-aws-metrics-to-partners-and-to-your-apps-in-real-time/) to connect to metrics partners like [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/) or [New Relic](https://newrelic.com/).

This is a terraform module that does the same thing but connects to one of your prometheus remote write endpoints directly.

## Features

- Blazingly fast, efficient metrics that you want directly in prometheus.
- Standardized prometheus  `__naming__` in `snake_case`
- Currently supporting `lambda` and `sqs` (More coming soon)

## Thank you
[AWS Recipe](https://aws-observability.github.io/aws-o11y-recipes/recipes/lambda-cw-metrics-go-amp/) - This draws heavily on this (using a modified version of the go code in their [lambda](https://github.com/aws-observability/aws-o11y-recipes/tree/main/sandbox/CWMetricStreamExporter/lambda))
